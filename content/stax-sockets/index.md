### Stax Pro Bias Socket (5-pin)
- Standard **Stax Pro Bias (580V)** configuration  
- **5-pin layout**
- Price: **$16 USD**

### Stax Normal Bias Socket (6-pin)
- Standard **Stax Normal Bias** configuration  
- **6-pin layout**
- Price: **$20 USD**

## Design & Materials

Both socket types share the same construction principles:

- Manufactured using **commercial-grade 3D printing**
- Housing made from **carbon fiber composite material**
- Rated for **continuous operation up to 195 °C**
- Designed for **high-voltage electrostatic headphone use**

The contact pins feature a **modular, removable design**, allowing for:
- Easier installation inside compact chassis
- Convenient soldering and wiring
- Simplified maintenance or replacement if needed

## Mounting Dimensions (DIY Drilling Guide)

To assist DIY builders with chassis preparation, both socket types use the **same mounting dimensions**.

### Standard Through-Hole Mounting
- **Recommended panel hole diameter:** **20 mm**
- **Maximum allowable hole diameter:** **22 mm**

This configuration is suitable for most flat-panel installations.

### Countersunk / Recessed Mounting (Recommended)
For a cleaner front-panel appearance, a countersunk design may be used with the following dimensions:

- **Recess depth:** **3.5 mm**
- **Lower hole diameter (socket body):** **19 mm**
- **Upper hole diameter (countersink):** **23–24 mm**

This stepped-hole approach ensures proper seating, mechanical stability, and consistent alignment.
