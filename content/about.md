title: "About Quartet Lab"
---

Being based in the United States allows me to ensure consistent build quality, clear communication, and reliable international shipping.

Quartet Lab is a personal workshop focused on the design and construction of electrostatic headphone amplifiers.

Each unit is built, tested, and adjusted by hand, with an emphasis on electrical safety, thermal stability, and serviceability.

I value clear communication, realistic lead times, and long-term support.
