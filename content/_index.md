### About Quartet Lab

Quartet Lab is a small, independent workshop focused on **DIY electrostatic headphone amplifiers**.

I began building electrostatic amplifiers around **2013**, initially to support fellow enthusiasts who were looking for reliable, carefully built solutions based on well-known designs such as **Megatron, T2, KGSSHV Carbon, Grounded Grid, and KGST**.

Around **2017**, due to a demanding work schedule, I stopped taking external build requests and focused only on building amplifiers for my own use.

In recent years, with more time available again, I have resumed accepting **limited build commissions**, continuing the same approach I have always followed: careful assembly, thorough testing, and clear communication.
