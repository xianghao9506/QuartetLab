## Overview

The **T2 Mini** is a modern engineered, compact interpretation of the legendary **STAX SRM-T2**.  
It preserves the **core circuit topology and sonic philosophy** of the original T2, while significantly improving practicality, manufacturability, and long-term serviceability.

While the original T2 relies on a large number of **obsolete and discontinued components**, the T2 Mini replaces these parts with **modern, readily available equivalents**, ensuring that the design can be reliably built, serviced, and supported today.

By extensively adopting **SMD components**, the T2 Mini achieves a **dramatically reduced PCB footprint**, allowing the amplifier to be housed in a much more compact chassis without compromising performance or stability.

Like the original T2, the T2 Mini employs a **Deep global feedback loop** with a tube-dominant signal path.  
The amplifier uses a total of **eight vacuum tubes**:

- **4 × 6DJ8 / ECC88**
- **4 × EL34 / 6CA7**

To ensure consistent performance, the T2 Mini incorporates **high-precision balance and offset servo circuits with a wide adjustment range**.  
These servos actively maintain optimal operating points, ensuring that **tube replacement or tube rolling does not disturb balance or offset values**, greatly simplifying ownership and long-term maintenance.
