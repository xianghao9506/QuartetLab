## Overview

**T2 Mini** is a compact, all-tube electrostatic headphone amplifier inspired by the classic T2 architecture. It is designed to deliver the speed, control, and openness electrostatic headphones are known for, while keeping the overall footprint and build complexity more approachable than a full-size T2.

Quartet Lab offers the T2 Mini as a custom build with careful attention to wiring layout, high-voltage safety, thermal management, and long-term reliability.

All units are **assembled, tested, and verified in the United States**.
