## Overview

The **Grounded Grid (GG)** is a **hybrid electrostatic headphone amplifier** designed by **Kevin Gilmore**, combining a solid-state front end with a tube-based output stage.  
It is widely regarded as one of the most **stable, reliable, and technically elegant** electrostatic amplifier designs, offering excellent performance while remaining practical for long-term daily use.

A defining feature of the Grounded Grid topology is that the **control grids of the output tubes are directly referenced to ground**.  
This design choice provides several important advantages:

- **Absolute DC reference stability**  
  By tying the grid to ground, the tube’s operating point is referenced to a fixed and noise-free potential, eliminating long-term drift caused by floating grid bias networks.

- **Reduced susceptibility to offset and noise**  
  A grounded grid greatly reduces sensitivity to leakage currents, grid bias variation, and power-supply-related disturbances, resulting in lower output offset and improved channel stability.

- **Improved linearity and predictability**  
  With the grid held at ground potential, tube behavior becomes more repeatable and consistent across tube samples, which is especially important when using beam tetrodes such as EL34 / 6CA7.

The Grounded Grid uses **four EL34 / 6CA7 output tubes**, making tube rolling both **easy and accessible**.  
Users can fine-tune tonal balance and presentation by selecting different EL34 variants without requiring circuit changes.

Similar to the **T2 and DIY T2 architectures**, the output tube plates in the GG are **loaded by constant current sources (CCS)**.  
This approach provides major technical benefits:

- Significantly increased voltage swing capability  
- A much wider and more linear operating region for the tubes  
- Improved distortion performance under real headphone loads  

In addition, the GG employs a **switchable DC servo–based offset balance system**, ensuring that both channels remain centered at optimal operating points over time.  
This servo can be enabled or disabled, allowing users to choose between **absolute long-term stability** or a fully passive signal path.

Overall, the Grounded Grid represents a carefully balanced design—**combining tube character, solid-state precision, and long-term reliability**—making it an excellent choice for users seeking a reference-level electrostatic amplifier without the complexity of larger all-tube designs.
