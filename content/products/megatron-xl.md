## Overview
The **Megatron XL** is a fully tube-based, two-chassis electrostatic headphone amplifier developed by **Kevin Gilmore** as an evolution of the original Megatron design.

While the original Megatron employs **four EL34 / 6CA7 tubes** in the output stage, the Megatron XL takes the design further by upgrading the output stage to **four directly heated 300B triodes**. This change introduces the characteristic qualities of the 300B tube—**a natural tonal density, refined micro-detail, and an organic presentation**—while maintaining the high-voltage stability required for electrostatic headphones.

The complete amplifier uses **a total of twelve vacuum tubes**:

**2 × ECC82**

**2 × ECC83**

**4 × EL34 / 6CA7**

**4 × 300B**

This architecture provides substantial flexibility for **tube rolling**, allowing users to fine-tune the sound character to their preference.

## Power Supply & Protection Design

The Megatron XL features a carefully engineered power supply system designed for long-term reliability and component protection.

- Three independent Golden Reference High Voltage (GRHV) power supplies are used for the high-voltage sections.

- The 15V low-voltage supply also employs a Golden Reference design, rather than conventional LM78xx / LM79xx regulators.

**Integrated protection and control modules include:**

- **Power-on inrush current suppression**

- **Short-circuit current limiting**

- **High-voltage delayed soft-start (~40 seconds)**

- **Dedicated soft-start filament supply for the 300B tubes**

These measures significantly extend the lifespan of the amplifier, tubes, and connected headphones.

The internal 300B filament supply includes a selectable configuration, **allowing future replacement of the 300B with 2A3 tubes**, providing an upgrade path without major hardware changes.
